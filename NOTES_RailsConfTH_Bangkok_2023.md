üí°Idea
    - how hard would it be to create a virtual USB/FIDO device in ruby to
      breakdown the passkey process
    - https://github.com/bulwarkid/virtual-fido
        - used in https://bulwark.id/
        - no MacOS support "yet"
        - Virtual FIDO creates a USB/IP server over local TCP to attach a
          virtual USB device. This USB device then emulates the USB/CTAP
          protocols to provide U2F/FIDO services to the host computer. In the
          demo, credentials created by the virtual device are stored in a local
          file, and approvals are done using the terminal.
